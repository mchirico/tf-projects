Terraform Projects

If you need to create VPC for EKS instance, run the following:

```bash
cd terraform-aws-ssh/examples/ec2-simple
terraform init
terraform verify
terraform apply

```

But will use `m1Virginia.pem`




Keep this clean... we don't need a lot of commits

```bash
git rebase --root -i
```
